# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001: Database Platform — Cloudflare D1

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-02

### Context

Palpitae runs on Cloudflare infrastructure (Workers, free tier). The database must integrate natively with Workers without HTTP overhead. PostgreSQL (previously listed in AGENTS.md) conflicts with the Cloudflare-first infrastructure decision.

### Decision

Use **Cloudflare D1** (SQLite) as the primary database.

### Consequences

- No PostgreSQL extensions (`uuid-ossp`, etc.) — UUIDs generated in the application layer (e.g., `crypto.randomUUID()`)
- All timestamps stored as `TEXT` in ISO 8601 UTC format (`datetime('now')`)
- Foreign key enforcement requires `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` per connection
- `CHECK` constraints are supported in SQLite
- Schema adapted for SQLite syntax throughout

## ADR-002: Migration Strategy — Wrangler D1 Migrations

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-02

### Context

Database changes must be versioned, reproducible, and auditable across local dev and production. Options considered: one-shot SQL script, Wrangler native migrations, ORM-managed migrations.

### Decision

Use **Wrangler D1 migrations** (`wrangler d1 migrations`).

- Each change is a versioned `.sql` file under `migrations/`
- Wrangler tracks applied migrations in a `d1_migrations` table automatically
- Migrations can be run locally (`--local`) and against production (`--remote`)
- All migration files are committed to version control

### Rules

- Create with: `wrangler d1 migrations create <description>`
- **Never edit an already-applied migration** — create a new one instead
- Every schema change, index addition, or data backfill requires a new migration file

### Consequences

- Clean audit trail of all schema changes
- Reproducible setup: `wrangler d1 migrations apply` from scratch recreates the full schema

---

## ADR-003: API Runtime — Cloudflare Workers + Hono

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-02

### Context

Backend must be lightweight, globally distributed, and natively integrated with D1. Options considered: Node.js (Hono/Fastify), Cloudflare Workers (Hono).

### Decision

Use **Cloudflare Workers** with the **Hono** framework.

### Consequences

- Zero cold start, edge-native execution
- D1 accessed via `env.DB` binding — no HTTP overhead
- Node.js APIs not available; use Web Standard APIs
- Local development via `wrangler dev`

---

## ADR-004: Prediction Locking — Derived at Runtime

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-02

### Context

Predictions must be locked after `match.start_time`. Options: store `locked_at` on the prediction row, or derive lock status from `match.start_time` at query time.

### Decision

**Derive prediction lock from `match.start_time` at runtime.** No `locked_at` column on `predictions`.

### Consequences

- Lock check: `IF now() >= match.start_time THEN reject edit`
- If a match is rescheduled, predictions automatically unlock/relock based on the new time — no stale data
- Simpler schema, no risk of `locked_at` going out of sync with match data

## ADR-005: Authentication — Direct Google OAuth 2.0

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-02

### Context

The product requires Google sign-in. Options evaluated:

| Option                  | Free tier limit | Cost risk                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Firebase Auth           | 50k MAU         | Billing surprise at scale |
| Supabase Auth           | 50k MAU         | Billing surprise at scale |
| Clerk                   | 5k MAU          | Hits limit early          |
| **Direct Google OAuth** | None            | Always free               |

The core constraint is **zero cost unless genuinely needed**. All third-party auth SaaS products impose MAU limits that create unpredictable billing as the product grows.

### Decision

Implement **direct Google OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code flow)** in the Hono API. No third-party auth SaaS.

- Frontend redirects user to Google consent screen
- API handles the OAuth callback, exchanges code for ID token
- Verify ID token signature using Google's public keys (JWKS endpoint)
- Create or update user row in D1 based on `email` + `provider_id`
- Issue a signed JWT (session token) stored as an `httpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie

### Security Requirements

- Use `state` parameter (CSRF protection) and PKCE on the OAuth flow
- Validate `nonce` in the ID token
- JWT signed with a strong secret stored in Workers secrets (not code)
- Token expiry enforced server-side

### Consequences

- No MAU limits, no third-party billing
- ~200 lines of auth implementation to own and maintain
- Full control over session lifecycle and user model
- Google's public JWKS endpoint must be fetched and cached (rotates periodically)

## ADR-007: Result Sync Strategy — Cron-Triggered Time-Window Poller

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-06-16

### Context

Match results must be fetched from football-data.org and scored against user predictions as soon as matches finish. The original approach (`maybeSyncResults`) fires as a `waitUntil` task on every `GET /matches` request — it calls the external API if any match started more than 3 hours ago and isn't marked `finished` yet.

This has two structural problems:

1. **Depends on user traffic.** If no one opens the app during or after a match, scoring never happens.
2. **Imprecise trigger window.** A fixed 3-hour threshold doesn't reflect actual match structure — it fires too early (matches are still running) or too late (missed results from previous matches).

### Decision

Add a **Cron Trigger** to the existing `palpitae-api` Worker that runs every **30 minutes** (on the hour and half-hour: `0,30 * * * *`) and polls only during the proven active window for each match.

**Timing math:**

```
First half:           45 min
First half stoppage:   5 min
Half-time interval:   15 min
Second half:          45 min
Second half stoppage:  5 min
─────────────────────────────
Minimum match length: 115 min  ← start polling here
```

The poller starts checking at `start_time + 115 min`. The upper bound is `start_time + 200 min`, which covers knockout rounds (extra time: 30 min + ~10 min stoppage + penalty shootout: ~15 min), with margin.

**Query:** select distinct `(competition, round)` pairs whose matches are in the active window.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.id AS comp_id, c.external_id, c.season, m.round
FROM matches m
JOIN competitions c ON c.id = m.competition_id
WHERE m.start_time <= ?  -- now − 115 min (ISO 8601, computed in JS)
  AND m.start_time >= ?  -- now − 200 min (ISO 8601, computed in JS)
  AND m.status != 'finished'
  AND c.provider = 'football-data'
```

> **Note:** the window bounds are computed in JS with `new Date(...).toISOString()` and bound as parameters, **not** via SQLite's `datetime('now', ...)`. `start_time` is stored as ISO 8601 with `T`/`Z` (`2026-06-16T22:00:00Z`, per ADR-001), and `datetime()` returns a space-separated form (`2026-06-16 23:21:20`). Since `start_time` is `TEXT`, the comparison is lexicographic — the `T` (ASCII 84) vs space (ASCII 32) at position 10 makes `start_time <= datetime(...)` always false. Computing the bounds in JS keeps both sides in the same ISO format (matching the existing `maybeSyncResults` convention).

For each active round, call `syncFixtures` scoped to that `matchday` (numeric rounds = group stage). Non-numeric rounds (knockout phases) fall back to a full-competition fetch. After syncing a competition's active rounds, run `scoreUnprocessedMatches` once for that competition. If a match is not yet finished according to the API, the next 30-minute tick tries again automatically.

**`maybeSyncResults` is kept** in the `GET /matches` request path as a fallback for now; it will be removed once the Cron is stable in production.

### Alternatives Considered

**Multi-source cascading poller (football-data → API-Football → scraper)**
Polls multiple APIs/sites every 5–10 minutes and falls through to the next source when one fails or rate-limits.

- Rejected: overkill at this scale. Copa do Mundo 2026 has at most 3 games/day. football-data.org free tier allows 10 req/min — we'll never hit the limit with ~1 call per active round per 30-minute tick. Adds significant maintenance surface with no concrete benefit today.

**Keep current (lazy request-triggered)**

- Rejected: depends on user traffic; broken for low-traffic periods or early morning matches.

### Implementation

The Cron Trigger is added to the **existing `palpitae-api` Worker** (not a separate service), since it shares the same D1 binding and `FOOTBALL_API_KEY` secret. No new deployment pipeline is needed.

- New file: `api/src/matches/poller.ts` — contains the active-window query and orchestration
- `api/src/index.ts` — default export becomes `{ fetch, scheduled }`; the `scheduled` handler calls the poller
- `api/wrangler.toml` — adds `[triggers] crons = ["0,30 * * * *"]`
- `api/src/matches/router.ts` — unchanged for now; `maybeSyncResults` stays as a fallback until the Cron is proven in production

### Consequences

- Results are scored within at most 30 minutes of a match finishing, regardless of user traffic. Matches start on the hour or half-hour; the active window is 85 min wide (200 − 115), so at most one tick passes between match end and scoring.
- `GET /matches` is now a pure DB read — no background API calls piggybacking on user requests
- football-data.org is called only while matches are actively in their time window — no wasted polling
- Knockout extra time and penalties are covered by the 200-min upper bound; if still not finished, the next day's manual admin sync catches edge cases
- If football-data.org is down during a tick, the next tick retries automatically; the scoring gap is bounded by the 30-min cron interval
- During the transition, both the Cron and `maybeSyncResults` may sync — this is safe because `scoreUnprocessedMatches` is idempotent (skips matches with `scored_at` set)

## ADR-006: Frontend Stack — Vite + React (Static Site)

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-03

### Context

The vision describes multiple frontend apps — one per competition — sharing a common design system. The API is stateless REST over HTTP with cookie-based auth. No SSR, no complex routing, and no data fetching framework is needed at this stage.

### Decision

Use **Vite + React (TypeScript)** as a static site under `web/`.

- Source lives in `web/src/`; built output is a static bundle in `web/dist/`
- No SSR, no meta-framework (Next.js, Remix, etc.)
- Styles via CSS Modules + CSS custom properties (design tokens)
- No UI component library — components are hand-built against the design token system
- API base URL injected at build time via `VITE_API_URL` (`.env.development` / `.env.production`)

### Design Token System

All visual values (colors, spacing, typography, shadows, radii) are declared as CSS custom properties in `web/src/styles/variables.css`. Components reference tokens via `var(--token-name)` — no raw values in component stylesheets.

**Brand palette (from `/assets/*.svg`):**
| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-primary` | `#49f21b` | CTAs, highlights, brand accent |
| `--color-bg` | `#0d0d0d` | Page background |
| `--color-surface` | `#1a1a1a` | Card / panel surfaces |
| `--color-text-primary` | `#ffffff` | Main text |

### Why not Next.js / Remix?

- No server-side rendering needed — data is user-specific and loaded after auth
- Cloudflare Workers serves the API; static assets can be served via Cloudflare Pages
- Keeps frontend dependencies minimal and deployment simple

### Consequences

- Each competition app will be its own Vite project with shared token conventions
- No framework router lock-in; client routing added only when needed (e.g., React Router)
- CSS Modules keep styles scoped to components with zero runtime overhead
- `vite preview` or Cloudflare Pages serves the static dist for production

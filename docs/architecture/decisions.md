# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001: Database Platform — Cloudflare D1

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-02

### Context

Palpitae runs on Cloudflare infrastructure (Workers, free tier). The database must integrate natively with Workers without HTTP overhead. PostgreSQL (previously listed in AGENTS.md) conflicts with the Cloudflare-first infrastructure decision.

### Decision

Use **Cloudflare D1** (SQLite) as the primary database.

### Consequences

- No PostgreSQL extensions (`uuid-ossp`, etc.) — UUIDs generated in the application layer (e.g., `crypto.randomUUID()`)
- All timestamps stored as `TEXT` in ISO 8601 UTC format (`datetime('now')`)
- Foreign key enforcement requires `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` per connection
- `CHECK` constraints are supported in SQLite
- Schema adapted for SQLite syntax throughout

## ADR-002: Migration Strategy — Wrangler D1 Migrations

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-02

### Context

Database changes must be versioned, reproducible, and auditable across local dev and production. Options considered: one-shot SQL script, Wrangler native migrations, ORM-managed migrations.

### Decision

Use **Wrangler D1 migrations** (`wrangler d1 migrations`).

- Each change is a versioned `.sql` file under `migrations/`
- Wrangler tracks applied migrations in a `d1_migrations` table automatically
- Migrations can be run locally (`--local`) and against production (`--remote`)
- All migration files are committed to version control

### Rules

- Create with: `wrangler d1 migrations create <description>`
- **Never edit an already-applied migration** — create a new one instead
- Every schema change, index addition, or data backfill requires a new migration file

### Consequences

- Clean audit trail of all schema changes
- Reproducible setup: `wrangler d1 migrations apply` from scratch recreates the full schema

## ADR-003: API Runtime — Cloudflare Workers + Hono

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-02

### Context

Backend must be lightweight, globally distributed, and natively integrated with D1. Options considered: Node.js (Hono/Fastify), Cloudflare Workers (Hono).

### Decision

Use **Cloudflare Workers** with the **Hono** framework.

### Consequences

- Zero cold start, edge-native execution
- D1 accessed via `env.DB` binding — no HTTP overhead
- Node.js APIs not available; use Web Standard APIs
- Local development via `wrangler dev`

## ADR-004: Prediction Locking — Derived at Runtime

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-02

### Context

Predictions must be locked after `match.start_time`. Options: store `locked_at` on the prediction row, or derive lock status from `match.start_time` at query time.

### Decision

**Derive prediction lock from `match.start_time` at runtime.** No `locked_at` column on `predictions`.

### Consequences

- Lock check: `IF now() >= match.start_time THEN reject edit`
- If a match is rescheduled, predictions automatically unlock/relock based on the new time — no stale data
- Simpler schema, no risk of `locked_at` going out of sync with match data

## ADR-005: Authentication — Direct Google OAuth 2.0

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-02

### Context

The product requires Google sign-in. Options evaluated:

| Option                  | Free tier limit | Cost risk                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Firebase Auth           | 50k MAU         | Billing surprise at scale |
| Supabase Auth           | 50k MAU         | Billing surprise at scale |
| Clerk                   | 5k MAU          | Hits limit early          |
| **Direct Google OAuth** | None            | Always free               |

The core constraint is **zero cost unless genuinely needed**. All third-party auth SaaS products impose MAU limits that create unpredictable billing as the product grows.

### Decision

Implement **direct Google OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code flow)** in the Hono API. No third-party auth SaaS.

- Frontend redirects user to Google consent screen
- API handles the OAuth callback, exchanges code for ID token
- Verify ID token signature using Google's public keys (JWKS endpoint)
- Create or update user row in D1 based on `email` + `provider_id`
- Issue a signed JWT (session token) stored as an `httpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie

### Security Requirements

- Use `state` parameter (CSRF protection) and PKCE on the OAuth flow
- Validate `nonce` in the ID token
- JWT signed with a strong secret stored in Workers secrets (not code)
- Token expiry enforced server-side

### Consequences

- No MAU limits, no third-party billing
- ~200 lines of auth implementation to own and maintain
- Full control over session lifecycle and user model
- Google's public JWKS endpoint must be fetched and cached (rotates periodically)
